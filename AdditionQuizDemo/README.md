## Addition Quiz Demo

This program administers a ten-question addition quiz to the user.  The numbers for the problem are chosen at random.  
The numbers and the answers are one or two digits.  

After asking the user the ten questions, the computer grades the quiz, telling the user the correct answer for any problem they got wrong.
## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
